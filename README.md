## Project Overview
DNA methylation is a genomic process used to
regulate the expression of a given gene. The
application of methylation clock models to
predict age can be used to address health
assessments as well as other areas of interest
such as cancer research; however, these are
challenging to build due to the vast amount of
genetic information that can be attributed to a
given individual. As a result, we must use
methods that are able to address the curse of dimensionality 
that arises due to the nature ofthis high-dimensional problem.

## Project Methodology

For this project,
I employ elastic net, boosted trees and random
forest as potential avenues to accurately model
the relationship between a collection of
approximately 500,000 CpG sites and the age of
a given individual, and compare the strengths
and weaknesses of each approach for their
success as a methylation clock.
